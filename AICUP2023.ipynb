The nodule is partially invested by thin fibrous tissue but lacks a distinct thick walled capsule.  Focally the Hurthle cell component displays some atypical features with nuclear crowding, nuclear grooves and mild chromatin pallor. There is corresponding membranous HBME1 expression in this focus, albeit with some non-specific backround staining.  Overall the atypical features are regarded as insufficient for a diagnosis of papillary carcinoma.  No significant mitotic activity, nuclear convolutions or necrosis is seen.

Importantly this atypical nodule iscompletely encapsulated with no capsular or vascular invasion, confined to the thyroid and completely excised.  In reality this is probably a dysplastic nodule with the potential to progress if left in situ.  Because there is no conceptof dysplasia in the thyroid and because it will be reliably cured by complete excision (as has been performed) I would classify it as a benign follicular adenoma.\tPHI:Null\n",

DCIS extends almost the full width of the specimen, over an approximate maximum extent of up to 89mm. There is focal DCIS associated necrosis and microcalcification. The adjacent breast tissue shows columnar cell change, fibroadenomatoid change, fibrocystic change, apocrine metaplasia, sclerosing adenosis and foci of benign microcalcifications. The overlying skin appears unremarkable with no evidence of Paget's disease. There are also scattered epithelioid granulomas throughout the breast, some in association with inflamed ducts, others adjacent to inflamed small calibre blood vessels, as well as, isolated within the subcutaneous tissue or breast parenchyma. Special stains for organisms are negative (truants and PASf x 2). No fibrinoid change of vessels is seen. There is no evidence of invasive carcinoma. A synoptic report for DCIS follows:\tPHI:Null\n",

            "449\t5650\tWithin the lower lobe there is an interstitial process.  Scattered through the lung there are numerous small stellate fibrotic scars that extend into the adjacent alveolar parenchyma.  Many of these scars are associated with relatively recent fibrosis and Masson body formation.  In addition to these changes small areas of the alveolar parenchyma show thickeningand contain a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate.  Around the scars and within the thickened interstitial areas eosinophils are relatively common and occasional small granulomas are seen.  The pleural is predominantly normal but in occasional areas pleural fibrosis with fibrosis of the underlying alveolar parenchyma has occurred.  Stains for S100 and CD1a are negative in that they fail to show Langerhan histiocytes within the foci of fibrosis.\tPHI:Null\n",

The general morphological appearance of the stellate scars would be in keeping with a Langerhans histiocytosis but this is almost invariably a diffuse process and does not account for the lack of changeswithin the interstitium of the upper lobe.  The appearances are not those of a usual interstitial pneumonitis with good preservation of the subpleural alveolar parenchyma in many areas.

            "450\t2763\tThere is residual intermediate to high grade sarcoma, distributed across approximately 32mm (eight consecutive slices).  The sarcoma is located within the subcutis and focally extends beneath the fascia. The poorly circumscribed residual tumour has a vaguely nodular configuration and displays two distinct morphological appearances. The majority of the tumour is composed of mild to moderately cellular spindle cells arranged in short fascicles with less cellular spindle cell areas showing intervening stromal hyalinisation.  The spindle cells have curved ends, evenly distributed chromatin, small nucleoli and pale eosinophilic cytoplasm. No perinuclear vacuoles are seen.  Scattered mitoses are present.  There is also an approximately 8mm distinctfocus of moderate to markedly pleomorphic, moderately cellular epithelioid, spindled and multinucleated tumour cells admixed with osteoclast-like giant cells and extravasated red blood cells. These tumour cells display highly irregular nuclei, vesicular chromatin, eosinophilic macronucleoli and amphophilic cytoplasm. Tumour cell mitoses number up to 20/HPF in this area.  No necrosis is seen.  The adjacent adipose tissue appears mature.  No perineural invasion is seen. Although difficult to distinguish from residual scar tissue, less pleomorphic spindle cell tumour focally extends to both the 9 o'clock and deep margins (block 4).

Within slice 3 and 4 there is an atypical cystic papillary lesion measuring approximately 10mm (2 consecutive slices) (Blocks 12 and 15). The papillary lesion expands two adjacent duct spaces and is composed of thin fibrovascular cores lined by somewhat monomorphic mild to moderately pleomorphic epithelial cells with round to elongated nuclei, even chromatin and occasional small nucleoli.  Rare mitotic figures are also seen.  A component of the proliferationshows residual columnar cell hyperplasia.  No necrosis or calcification is seen. The lesion has a well developed fibrous capsule. Immunostains demonstrate strong diffuse epithelial ER expression and absent myoepithelial cells both withand around the dilated space. There is some adjacent subacute haemorrhage, fibrosis and neovascularisation suggestive of previous biopsy.  A diathermied incision line extends towards the lesion and focally disrupts it. The lesion abutsthis diathermied excision line, however, allowing for some disruption, the lesion is about 2.5mm clear of the deep margin (block 12), about 3.5mm clear of the superior margin (block 12) and well clear (> 10mm) of the other margins.

Focally there is an area of sheet-like growth in which tumour cells display more pronounced nuclear pleomorphism, vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli (block B17). At its deepest point of invasion, in an area where the myometrium is relatively thin, the tumour extends close to the serosal surface, 22.8mm through a myometrium 23mm thick (B25).  Elsewhere the tumour invades 41.5mm throughmyometrium 48.5mm in maximal thickness B10/B11). The serosa does not appear involved by tumour.  There is extensive lymphovascular invasion both within the inner and outerhalf of the myometrium.  No definite perineural invasion is seen.  The cervix is uninvolved by tumour.  The uterus also shows several leiomyomata including a lipoleiomyoma which is focally invaded by carcinoma.  A leiomyoma is also present in the posterior lower segment expanding the stromal compartment of the cervix.  The ectocervix and endocervix are otherwise unremarkarkable and uninvolved by tumour. The mucosa of the left fallopian tube is expanded by foamy histiocytes, however, no carcinoma is seen.  The right fallopian tube is unremarkable.  The right and left ovaries are unremarkable and uninvolved.  Within the right parametrium there are two leiomyomas.\tPHI:Null\n",

Additionally within the polyp there is background of a lower grade endometrioid carcinoma with mucinous differentiation, grade 2 which comprises about 75% of the tumour volume, with serous carcinoma about 20%. There is also a small focal area of more solid malignancy with increased mitoses which lies within the polyp and adjacent endometrium of the uterus within a 4mm area (&amp;lt;5% of the tumour, block 9). This small focus retains cytokeratin expression favouring a diagnosis of poorly differentiated/ de-differentiated endometrioid carcinoma.\tPHI:Null\n",
